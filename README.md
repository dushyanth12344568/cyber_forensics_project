How It Works
Blacklist Check: Uses Google Safe Browsing API to check if the URL is blacklisted.

Domain Age Check: Uses whois to check when the domain was registered.

Suspicious URL Patterns: Detects phishing indicators (e.g., hyphens, .ru, free, login).

Setup Instructions
Install dependencies:

pip install requests python-whois
pip install tk
